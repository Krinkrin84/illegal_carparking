PARKING_THRESHOLD = 25         # frames - time to confirm parking
OCCLUSION_TOLERANCE_FRAMES = 375  # frames - occlusion tolerance
```

### Detection Settings
```python
# config.py
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.35    # YOLO detection confidence
IOU_THRESHOLD = 0.4           # Intersection over Union threshold
HISTOGRAM_BINS = 32           # Color analysis precision
```

### Vehicle Classes

# config.py
VEHICLE_CLASSES = {
    2: 'car',          # Passenger vehicles
    3: 'motorcycle',   # Two-wheelers
    5: 'bus',          # Public transport
    7: 'truck'         # Commercial vehicles
}
